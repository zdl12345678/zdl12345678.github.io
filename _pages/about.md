Hello! I am Dongliang Zhu (朱栋梁) — thank you for visiting my homepage.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Wuhan University (WHU), supervised by [Dr. Ruimin Hu](https://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?a=show&catid=69&id=71&lang=2).
 Since August 2025, I have also been a visiting research intern at Great Bay University (GBU), advised by [**Prof. Zitong Yu**](https://zitong-yu.github.io/yzt/).

My research interests include **multimodal deception detection**, **audiovisual learning**, and **video anomaly detection**.
 My long-term goal is to develop intelligent and interpretable perception systems that can understand human behaviors.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my M.S. degree from Hubei University of Technology in September 2021, where I was co-advised by [**Prof. Chunyan Zeng**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BWL5zN8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [**Prof. Zhifeng Wang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q23ZarcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
 My master’s research focused on speech recognition based on deep learning. I mainly analyzed challenges in speech data and designed appropriate deep models to address these issues.
